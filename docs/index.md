## Biography

Hello!

I am Gabriel. I am currently working on my masterâ€™s thesis on Incremental Text Representation under the 
supervision of [Felipe Bravo-Marquez](https://felipebravom.com) at University of Chile.

I am member of the [ReLeLa](https://relela.com/) research group at [DCC UChile](https://www.dcc.uchile.cl/) and my research interests include Incremental Learning, Natural Language Processing and Data Streams.

Besides research I really enjoy teaching. On my spare time I enjoy from doing exercises and learning new things from books and videos.

## Research Areas

I specialize in the extraction of knowledge and information from unstructured data, with a focus on natural language text and streaming learning. My research interests encompass several interrelated fields in this domain.
