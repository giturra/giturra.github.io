## Biography


Hello!


I am Gabriel, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [Information Access and Artificial Intelligence Research Group](https://iai.group/) at the University of Stavanger, supervised by Dr. [Petra Galuscakova](https://galuscakova.github.io/).

Previously, I was a member of the [Representations for Learning and Language Research Group](https://relela.com/) and earned both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science at the University of Chile, under the supervision of Dr. [Felipe Bravo-Marquez](https://felipebravom.com/). Our work focused on the study of Incremental Word Representation and Streaming Information.

My research interests include Information Retrieval, Large Language Models, and Natural Language Processing. In my leisure time, I enjoy physical exercise, especially biking, and I satisfy my curiosity by exploring new subjects through books and videos.



## Research Areas

I specialize in the extraction of knowledge and information from unstructured data, with a focus on natural language text and streaming learning. My research interests encompass several interrelated fields in this domain.
