## Biography


Hello!

I am Gabriel, and I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.dcc.uchile.cl/) at the University of Chile. My thesis focused on the study and implementation of incremental text representation under the supervision of Professor [Felipe Bravo-Marquez](https://felipebravom.com).

I work as a part-time professor for the Data Science Laboratory course at the University of Chile. Additionally, I am an active member of the [ReLeLa](https://relela.com/) research group at DCC UChile. My research interests encompass Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and Data Streams. Currently, I am actively seeking PhD opportunities.

In my leisure time, I engage in physical exercise, especially biking, and I satisfy my curiosity by exploring new subjects through books and videos


## Research Areas

I specialize in the extraction of knowledge and information from unstructured data, with a focus on natural language text and streaming learning. My research interests encompass several interrelated fields in this domain.
