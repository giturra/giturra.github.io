## Biography


Hello!

I am Gabriel, and I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.dcc.uchile.cl/) at the University of Chile. My thesis focused on the study and implementation of incremental text representations under the supervision of Professor [Felipe Bravo-Marquez](https://felipebravom.com).

Currently, I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Replai SpA](https://replai.cl/about), a Chilean startup that seeks to revolutionize the way meta-search engines work in specific domains, including law and healthcare. 

My research interests encompass Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models and Natural Language Processing. In my leisure time, I engage in physical exercise, especially biking, and I satisfy my curiosity by exploring new subjects through books and videos



## Research Areas

I specialize in the extraction of knowledge and information from unstructured data, with a focus on natural language text and streaming learning. My research interests encompass several interrelated fields in this domain.
