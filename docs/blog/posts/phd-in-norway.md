# Being a PhD in Computer Science in Norway

It has been nearly six months since I began my PhD position at the University of Stavanger in Norway, and it has also been quite some time since my last blog post. Therefore, I decided to write this post to explain how I got my PhD position and the reasons behind my decision to come to such a beautiful country as Norway. Also, this is my first post in English, so some expressions or ideas might not be perfectly written. If something is unclear, please let me know, I am always interested in improving my English :)

It is also relevant to highlight that this post is primarily intended for students who are interested in pursuing a PhD in Computer Science or Artificial Intelligence (AI), which are the fields I am currently researching. However, some of the points I mention here may also apply to other areas. Consequently, if you are looking to pursue research in other specific fields in Norway, this post could still be relevant for you :D

Before getting to the important point and probably the reason you clicked on this article-you need to ask yourself an important question: **Do you really want to pursue a PhD?** **Are you sure?** Why am I asking you this? Because after working here for six months, I must admit it has not been an easy task. You must understand that doing a PhD requires strong mental willpower. You will be working on a research project, yes, RESEARCH, not engineering for at least three or four years, and you will probably have to leave many things behind, including your job, family, friends, and your entire life in your home country. So, if you still want to pursue a PhD after all these warnings, keep reading.

## Why you must choose Norway for doing you PhD?

In my case, I must say that I didn’t come here for the reasons I will outline below-my situation was a bit different, but it’s not relevant. So, what are the reasons you should choose Norway for your PhD?

You are not a student, you are employee: As a PhD candidate in Norway, you are considered a full-time employee rather than just a student, which means access to several benefits that other countries do not provide for PhD students, including:

  - Employment Contract: You have a formal employment contract, which outlines your rights and duties, just like any other employee in Norway
  - Social Benefits: 

    - Paid Holidays: You have the right to paid holidays, following the same regulations as other employees in Norway (typically five weeks per year).

    - Sick Leave and Parental Leave: You have access to sick leave and parental leave on the same terms as other Norwegian employees.

    - Pension access: Membership in the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund is mandatory, giving you access to retirement and disability pensions, as well as favorable housing loan conditions.
  
  - Health Care System: As an employee, you have full access to Norway’s public health care system. In other countries, such as Australia, you must get a health insurance to cover the entire period you are working on your PhD, which actually it is not cheap.
