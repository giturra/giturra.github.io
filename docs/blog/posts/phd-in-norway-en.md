# Being a PhD in Computer Science in Norway

It has been nearly eight months since I began my PhD position at the University of Stavanger in Norway, and it has also been quite some time since my last blog post. Therefore, I decided to write this post to explain how I got my PhD position and the reasons behind my decision to come to such a beautiful country as Norway. Also, this is my first post in English, so some expressions or ideas might not be perfectly written. If something is unclear, please let me know, I am always interested in improving my English :)

It is also relevant to highlight that this post is primarily intended for students who are interested in pursuing a PhD in Computer Science or Artificial Intelligence (AI), which are the fields I am currently researching. However, some of the points I mention here may also apply to other areas. Consequently, if you are looking to pursue research in other specific fields in Norway, this post could still be relevant for you :D

Before getting to the important point and probably the reason you clicked on this article-you need to ask yourself an important question: **Do you really want to pursue a PhD?** **Are you sure?** Why am I asking you this? Because after working here for eight months, I must admit it has not been an easy task. You must understand that doing a PhD requires strong mental willpower. You will be working on a research project, yes, RESEARCH, not engineering for at least three or four years, and you will probably have to leave many things behind, including your job, family, friends, and your entire life in your home country. So, if you still want to pursue a PhD after all these warnings, keep reading.

## Why you must choose Norway for doing you PhD?

In my case, I must say that I didn’t come here for the reasons I will outline below-my situation was a bit different, but it’s not relevant. So, what are the reasons you should choose Norway for your PhD?

### Employee Status and Benefits

You are not a student, you are employee: As a PhD candidate in Norway, you are considered a full-time employee rather than just a student, which means access to several benefits that other countries do not provide for PhD students, including:

* Employment Contract: You have a formal employment contract, which outlines your rights and duties, just like any other employee in Norway

* Paid Holidays: You have the right to paid holidays, following the same regulations as other employees in Norway (typically five weeks per year).

* Sick Leave and Parental Leave: You have access to sick leave and parental leave on the same terms as other Norwegian employees.

* Pension access: Membership in the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund is mandatory, giving you access to retirement and disability pensions, as well as favorable housing loan conditions.

* Health Care System: As an employee, you have full access to Norway’s public health care system. In other countries, such as Australia, you must get a health insurance to cover the entire period you are working on your PhD, which actually it is not cheap. However, in some internet you can find influencers saying that healthcare is free, which is not true.

### No Tuition Fees

Norwegian public universities do not charge tuition fees for PhD students, regardless of nationality. This makes Norway one of the most affordable options for doctoral studies in Europe

### Research Funding and Mobility

Most PhD contracts include a research budget or “working capital” (often around 20,000–40,000 NOK per year), which can be used for conferences, courses, and research-related travel. This enables you to present your work internationally and build a global network

### Academic Environment and Supervision

Norwegian academic culture is known for its flat hierarchy and collaborative spirit. Supervisors are approachable, and PhD candidates are encouraged to work independently, contribute ideas, and take initiative in their research projects.

* Research Independence: You have significant freedom to shape your research within the project’s scope, developing both technical and soft skills.

* Support Networks: Universities offer support through mentoring, workshops, and social events, and most staff are unionized, ensuring robust employee rights.

### Quality of Life

Norway consistently ranks among the best countries for quality of life. You’ll enjoy stunning natural landscapes, a clean environment, and a strong emphasis on work-life balance. Outdoor activities like hiking, skiing, and boating are easily accessible and widely enjoyed.

## The Structure of a PhD in Computer Science

* Duration: Typically three to four years full-time, with some positions including a teaching component (usually 25% of your time).

* Coursework: You must complete about 30 ECTS credits of advanced courses, often spread over the first year.

* Research: The core of your PhD is original research, culminating in a thesis, which is often a collection of peer-reviewed papers plus an introductory summary.

* Teaching: Many positions require some teaching or supervision of students, providing valuable experience for academic or industry roles

## Practical Tips for Prospective PhDs

* Be Certain of Your Motivation: A PhD is a long-term commitment that requires genuine interest in research and perseverance through setbacks.

* Engage with the Community: Build relationships with peers, supervisors, and international collaborators. This network will support you both professionally and personally.

* Take Advantage of Benefits: Use your research budget for conferences and training, and make time to enjoy Norway’s natural and cultural offerings. In particular case, I have attended to a Summer School and soon to my first conference as PhD student.

* Balance Work and Life: While the workload can be intense, Norwegian culture values balance—don’t neglect your well-being.

### Challenges

However, not everything is easy in Norway, the wheather and climate is something consider if you want to move to Norway for doing your PhD.

#### Wheather, Darkness, and Adaptation

One of the most significant challenges of living in Norway is the climate. Winters can be extremely cold, with temperatures often dropping well below zero, especially in the inland and northern regions. Snow and ice are common, making daily activities like commuting and shopping more difficult. For those not used to such conditions, the first winter can be particularly tough.

Another aspect is the limited daylight during the winter months. In many parts of Norway, especially above the Arctic Circle, you may experience only a few hours of daylight—or even polar nights with no sun at all—for several weeks. Even in the south, winter days are very short. This lack of sunlight can affect your mood and energy levels, and some people may experience seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Adapting to this environment requires a proactive approach: investing in warm clothing, using light therapy lamps, and finding indoor activities to stay active and positive.

#### Lifestyle Adjustments and Cost of Living

Apart from the weather, moving to Norway means adapting to a different lifestyle and set of customs. Norwegians tend to value privacy and personal space, and social interactions may feel more reserved compared to other cultures. The climate also influences social life—outdoor activities can be limited in winter, and people often spend more time indoors.

Additionally, Norway is known for its high cost of living. Everyday expenses like housing, groceries, transportation, and eating out can be much higher than in many other countries. While the salary and benefits for PhD students help offset these costs, careful budgeting and financial planning are essential, especially in the first months as you settle in.

## Conclusion

First of all, if you have reached this point thank you for reading :)

A PhD in Computer Science in Norway offers a unique blend of professional employment, robust social benefits, financial security, and a supportive academic environment—all set in a country renowned for its natural beauty and high quality of life. If you are passionate about research and ready for a challenging but rewarding journey, Norway is an excellent choice.

## Few personal notes

I should mention that although this experience has been challenging and complex—such as moving to a country where Spanish is not the first language, with a completely different culture and climate—I have been able to have experiences that I never could have had in my home country (Chile) and to meet many incredible people from different countries like Italy, Spain, France, Iran, Norway, India, Georgia, and Pakistan.
