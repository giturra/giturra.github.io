I am Gabriel. I am currently working on my master\u2019s thesis on Incremental Text Representation under the supervision of Felipe Bravo-M\u00e1rquez at University of Chile. I am member of the ReLeLa research group at DCC UChile and my research interests include Incremental Learning, Natural Language Processing and Streaming Data. Besides research I really enjoy teaching. On my spare time I enjoy from doing exercises and learning new things from books and videos.
