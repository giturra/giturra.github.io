    <h2 id="being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/">Being a PhD in Computer Science in Norway</a></h2>
<p>It has been nearly eight months since I began my PhD position at the University of Stavanger in Norway, and it has also been quite some time since my last blog post. Therefore, I decided to write this post to explain how I got my PhD position and the reasons behind my decision to come to such a beautiful country as Norway. Also, this is my first post in English, so some expressions or ideas might not be perfectly written. If something is unclear, please let me know, I am always interested in improving my English :)</p>
<p>It is also relevant to highlight that this post is primarily intended for students who are interested in pursuing a PhD in Computer Science or Artificial Intelligence (AI), which are the fields I am currently researching. However, some of the points I mention here may also apply to other areas. Consequently, if you are looking to pursue research in other specific fields in Norway, this post could still be relevant for you :D</p>
<p>Before getting to the important point and probably the reason you clicked on this article-you need to ask yourself an important question: <strong>Do you really want to pursue a PhD?</strong> <strong>Are you sure?</strong> Why am I asking you this? Because after working here for eight months, I must admit it has not been an easy task. You must understand that doing a PhD requires strong mental willpower. You will be working on a research project, yes, RESEARCH, not engineering for at least three or four years, and you will probably have to leave many things behind, including your job, family, friends, and your entire life in your home country. So, if you still want to pursue a PhD after all these warnings, keep reading.</p>
<h3 id="why-you-must-choose-norway-for-doing-you-phd"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/#why-you-must-choose-norway-for-doing-you-phd">Why you must choose Norway for doing you PhD?</a></h3>
<p>In my case, I must say that I didn’t come here for the reasons I will outline below-my situation was a bit different, but it’s not relevant. So, what are the reasons you should choose Norway for your PhD?</p>
<h4 id="employee-status-and-benefits"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/#employee-status-and-benefits">Employee Status and Benefits</a></h4>
<p>You are not a student, you are employee: As a PhD candidate in Norway, you are considered a full-time employee rather than just a student, which means access to several benefits that other countries do not provide for PhD students, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Employment Contract: You have a formal employment contract, which outlines your rights and duties, just like any other employee in Norway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paid Holidays: You have the right to paid holidays, following the same regulations as other employees in Norway (typically five weeks per year).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sick Leave and Parental Leave: You have access to sick leave and parental leave on the same terms as other Norwegian employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pension access: Membership in the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund is mandatory, giving you access to retirement and disability pensions, as well as favorable housing loan conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health Care System: As an employee, you have full access to Norway’s public health care system. In other countries, such as Australia, you must get a health insurance to cover the entire period you are working on your PhD, which actually it is not cheap. However, in some internet you can find influencers saying that healthcare is free, which is not true.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="no-tuition-fees"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/#no-tuition-fees">No Tuition Fees</a></h4>
<p>Norwegian public universities do not charge tuition fees for PhD students, regardless of nationality. This makes Norway one of the most affordable options for doctoral studies in Europe</p>
<h4 id="research-funding-and-mobility"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/#research-funding-and-mobility">Research Funding and Mobility</a></h4>
<p>Most PhD contracts include a research budget or “working capital” (often around 20,000–40,000 NOK per year), which can be used for conferences, courses, and research-related travel. This enables you to present your work internationally and build a global network</p>
<h4 id="academic-environment-and-supervision"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/#academic-environment-and-supervision">Academic Environment and Supervision</a></h4>
<p>Norwegian academic culture is known for its flat hierarchy and collaborative spirit. Supervisors are approachable, and PhD candidates are encouraged to work independently, contribute ideas, and take initiative in their research projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Research Independence: You have significant freedom to shape your research within the project’s scope, developing both technical and soft skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support Networks: Universities offer support through mentoring, workshops, and social events, and most staff are unionized, ensuring robust employee rights.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="quality-of-life"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/#quality-of-life">Quality of Life</a></h4>
<p>Norway consistently ranks among the best countries for quality of life. You’ll enjoy stunning natural landscapes, a clean environment, and a strong emphasis on work-life balance. Outdoor activities like hiking, skiing, and boating are easily accessible and widely enjoyed.</p>
<h3 id="the-structure-of-a-phd-in-computer-science"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/#the-structure-of-a-phd-in-computer-science">The Structure of a PhD in Computer Science</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Duration: Typically three to four years full-time, with some positions including a teaching component (usually 25% of your time).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coursework: You must complete about 30 ECTS credits of advanced courses, often spread over the first year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research: The core of your PhD is original research, culminating in a thesis, which is often a collection of peer-reviewed papers plus an introductory summary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching: Many positions require some teaching or supervision of students, providing valuable experience for academic or industry roles</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tips-for-prospective-phds"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/#practical-tips-for-prospective-phds">Practical Tips for Prospective PhDs</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be Certain of Your Motivation: A PhD is a long-term commitment that requires genuine interest in research and perseverance through setbacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage with the Community: Build relationships with peers, supervisors, and international collaborators. This network will support you both professionally and personally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take Advantage of Benefits: Use your research budget for conferences and training, and make time to enjoy Norway’s natural and cultural offerings. In particular case, I have attended to a Summer School and soon to my first conference as PhD student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balance Work and Life: While the workload can be intense, Norwegian culture values balance—don’t neglect your well-being.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="challenges"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/#challenges">Challenges</a></h4>
<p>However, not everything is easy in Norway, the wheather and climate is something consider if you want to move to Norway for doing your PhD.</p>
<h5 id="wheather-darkness-and-adaptation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/#wheather-darkness-and-adaptation">Wheather, Darkness, and Adaptation</a></h5>
<p>One of the most significant challenges of living in Norway is the climate. Winters can be extremely cold, with temperatures often dropping well below zero, especially in the inland and northern regions. Snow and ice are common, making daily activities like commuting and shopping more difficult. For those not used to such conditions, the first winter can be particularly tough.</p>
<p>Another aspect is the limited daylight during the winter months. In many parts of Norway, especially above the Arctic Circle, you may experience only a few hours of daylight—or even polar nights with no sun at all—for several weeks. Even in the south, winter days are very short. This lack of sunlight can affect your mood and energy levels, and some people may experience seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Adapting to this environment requires a proactive approach: investing in warm clothing, using light therapy lamps, and finding indoor activities to stay active and positive.</p>
<h5 id="lifestyle-adjustments-and-cost-of-living"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/#lifestyle-adjustments-and-cost-of-living">Lifestyle Adjustments and Cost of Living</a></h5>
<p>Apart from the weather, moving to Norway means adapting to a different lifestyle and set of customs. Norwegians tend to value privacy and personal space, and social interactions may feel more reserved compared to other cultures. The climate also influences social life—outdoor activities can be limited in winter, and people often spend more time indoors.</p>
<p>Additionally, Norway is known for its high cost of living. Everyday expenses like housing, groceries, transportation, and eating out can be much higher than in many other countries. While the salary and benefits for PhD students help offset these costs, careful budgeting and financial planning are essential, especially in the first months as you settle in.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>First of all, if you have reached this point thank you for reading :)</p>
<p>A PhD in Computer Science in Norway offers a unique blend of professional employment, robust social benefits, financial security, and a supportive academic environment—all set in a country renowned for its natural beauty and high quality of life. If you are passionate about research and ready for a challenging but rewarding journey, Norway is an excellent choice.</p>
<h3 id="few-personal-notes"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/being-a-phd-in-computer-science-in-norway/#few-personal-notes">Few personal notes</a></h3>
<p>I should mention that although this experience has been challenging and complex—such as moving to a country where Spanish is not the first language, with a completely different culture and climate—I have been able to have experiences that I never could have had in my home country (Chile) and to meet many incredible people from different countries like Italy, Spain, France, Iran, Norway, India, Georgia, and Pakistan.</p>

<p>Han pasado casi ocho meses desde que comencé mi puesto de doctorado en la Universidad de Stavanger en Noruega, y también ha pasado bastante tiempo desde mi última publicación en el blog. Por eso, decidí escribir esta entrada para explicar cómo conseguí mi puesto de doctorado y las razones detrás de mi decisión de venir a un país tan hermoso como Noruega. Además, esta es mi primera publicación en inglés, así que algunas expresiones o ideas podrían no estar perfectamente escritas. Si algo no queda claro, por favor házmelo saber, siempre estoy interesado en mejorar mi inglés :)</p>
<p>También es relevante destacar que esta publicación está principalmente dirigida a estudiantes que estén interesados en realizar un doctorado en Ciencias de la Computación o Inteligencia Artificial (IA), que son los campos en los que actualmente investigo. Sin embargo, algunos de los puntos que menciono aquí pueden aplicarse también a otras áreas. Por lo tanto, si buscas realizar investigación en otros campos específicos en Noruega, esta publicación aún podría ser relevante para ti :D</p>
<p>Antes de llegar al punto importante y probablemente la razón por la que hiciste clic en este artículo, necesitas hacerte una pregunta importante: <strong>¿Realmente quieres hacer un doctorado?</strong> <strong>¿Estás seguro?</strong> ¿Por qué te pregunto esto? Porque después de trabajar aquí durante ocho meses, debo admitir que no ha sido una tarea fácil. Debes entender que hacer un doctorado requiere una gran fuerza de voluntad mental. Trabajarás en un proyecto de investigación, sí, INVESTIGACIÓN, no ingeniería, durante al menos tres o cuatro años, y probablemente tendrás que dejar muchas cosas atrás, incluyendo tu trabajo, familia, amigos y toda tu vida en tu país de origen. Así que, si después de todas estas advertencias aún quieres hacer un doctorado, sigue leyendo.</p>

<p>En mi caso, debo decir que no vine aquí por las razones que mencionaré a continuación—mi situación fue un poco diferente, pero eso no es relevante. Entonces, ¿cuáles son las razones por las que deberías elegir Noruega para tu doctorado?</p>
<h4 id="estatus-de-empleado-y-beneficios"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/ser-estudiante-de-doctorado-en-ciencias-de-la-computaci%C3%B3n-en-noruega/#estatus-de-empleado-y-beneficios">Estatus de Empleado y Beneficios</a></h4>
<p>No eres un estudiante, eres un empleado: Como doctorando en Noruega, eres considerado un empleado a tiempo completo y no solo un estudiante, lo que significa acceso a varios beneficios que otros países no ofrecen a los estudiantes de doctorado, incluyendo:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Contrato de trabajo:</strong> Tienes un contrato de trabajo formal, que detalla tus derechos y deberes, igual que cualquier otro empleado en Noruega.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vacaciones pagadas:</strong> Tienes derecho a vacaciones pagadas, siguiendo las mismas regulaciones que otros empleados en Noruega (normalmente cinco semanas al año).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Licencia por enfermedad y licencia parental:</strong> Tienes acceso a licencia por enfermedad y licencia parental en los mismos términos que los demás empleados noruegos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acceso a pensión:</strong> La afiliación al Fondo Noruego de Pensiones del Servicio Público es obligatoria, lo que te da acceso a pensiones por jubilación y discapacidad, así como condiciones favorables para préstamos de vivienda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sistema de salud:</strong> Como empleado, tienes acceso completo al sistema de salud pública noruego. En otros países, como Australia, debes contratar un seguro de salud para cubrir todo el período de tu doctorado, lo cual no es barato. Sin embargo, en internet a veces puedes encontrar influencers que dicen que la atención médica es gratuita, lo cual no es cierto.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sin-tasas-de-matricula"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/ser-estudiante-de-doctorado-en-ciencias-de-la-computaci%C3%B3n-en-noruega/#sin-tasas-de-matricula">Sin tasas de matrícula</a></h4>
<p>Las universidades públicas noruegas no cobran tasas de matrícula a los estudiantes de doctorado, sin importar su nacionalidad. Esto hace que Noruega sea una de las opciones más asequibles para estudios doctorales en Europa.</p>
<h4 id="financiamiento-para-investigacion-y-movilidad"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/ser-estudiante-de-doctorado-en-ciencias-de-la-computaci%C3%B3n-en-noruega/#financiamiento-para-investigacion-y-movilidad">Financiamiento para investigación y movilidad</a></h4>
<p>La mayoría de los contratos de doctorado incluyen un presupuesto de investigación o “capital de trabajo” (a menudo entre 20,000 y 40,000 NOK por año), que puede usarse para conferencias, cursos y viajes relacionados con la investigación. Esto te permite presentar tu trabajo internacionalmente y construir una red global.</p>
<h4 id="ambiente-academico-y-supervision"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/ser-estudiante-de-doctorado-en-ciencias-de-la-computaci%C3%B3n-en-noruega/#ambiente-academico-y-supervision">Ambiente académico y supervisión</a></h4>
<p>La cultura académica noruega es conocida por su jerarquía plana y espíritu colaborativo. Los supervisores son accesibles y se alienta a los doctorandos a trabajar de manera independiente, aportar ideas y tomar la iniciativa en sus proyectos de investigación.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Independencia en la investigación:</strong> Tienes una libertad significativa para orientar tu investigación dentro del alcance del proyecto, desarrollando tanto habilidades técnicas como blandas.</li>
<li><strong>Redes de apoyo:</strong> Las universidades ofrecen apoyo a través de mentorías, talleres y eventos sociales, y la mayoría del personal está sindicalizado, lo que garantiza sólidos derechos laborales.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Duración:</strong> Normalmente de tres a cuatro años a tiempo completo, con algunos puestos que incluyen una componente docente (usualmente el 25% del tiempo).</li>
<li><strong>Cursos:</strong> Debes completar aproximadamente 30 créditos ECTS de cursos avanzados, generalmente distribuidos durante el primer año.</li>
<li><strong>Investigación:</strong> El núcleo de tu doctorado es la investigación original, que culmina en una tesis, que suele ser una colección de artículos revisados por pares más un resumen introductorio.</li>
<li><strong>Docencia:</strong> Muchos puestos requieren cierta docencia o supervisión de estudiantes, lo que brinda una valiosa experiencia tanto para roles académicos como en la industria.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asegúrate de tu motivación:</strong> Un doctorado es un compromiso a largo plazo que requiere un interés genuino por la investigación y perseverancia ante los contratiempos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Involúcrate con la comunidad:</strong> Construye relaciones con tus compañeros, supervisores y colaboradores internacionales. Esta red te apoyará tanto profesional como personalmente.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aprovecha los beneficios:</strong> Utiliza tu presupuesto de investigación para asistir a conferencias y formaciones, y reserva tiempo para disfrutar de las maravillas naturales y culturales de Noruega. En mi caso particular, he asistido a una escuela de verano y pronto asistiré a mi primera conferencia como estudiante de doctorado.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Equilibra trabajo y vida personal:</strong> Aunque la carga de trabajo puede ser intensa, la cultura noruega valora el equilibrio—no descuides tu bienestar.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="desafios"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/ser-estudiante-de-doctorado-en-ciencias-de-la-computaci%C3%B3n-en-noruega/#desafios">Desafíos</a></h4>
<p>Sin embargo, no todo es fácil en Noruega; el clima y el tiempo son factores a considerar si quieres mudarte a Noruega para hacer tu doctorado.</p>
<h5 id="clima-oscuridad-y-adaptacion"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/ser-estudiante-de-doctorado-en-ciencias-de-la-computaci%C3%B3n-en-noruega/#clima-oscuridad-y-adaptacion">Clima, oscuridad y adaptación</a></h5>
<p>Uno de los desafíos más significativos de vivir en Noruega es el clima. Los inviernos pueden ser extremadamente fríos, con temperaturas que a menudo bajan mucho de cero, especialmente en las regiones del interior y del norte. La nieve y el hielo son comunes, lo que dificulta actividades diarias como desplazarse o hacer compras. Para quienes no están acostumbrados a estas condiciones, el primer invierno puede ser especialmente duro.</p>
<p>Otro aspecto es la limitada luz diurna durante los meses de invierno. En muchas partes de Noruega, especialmente por encima del Círculo Polar Ártico, puedes experimentar solo unas pocas horas de luz al día—o incluso noches polares sin sol durante varias semanas. Incluso en el sur, los días de invierno son muy cortos. Esta falta de luz solar puede afectar tu estado de ánimo y niveles de energía, y algunas personas pueden experimentar trastorno afectivo estacional (SAD). Adaptarse a este entorno requiere un enfoque proactivo: invertir en ropa abrigada, usar lámparas de terapia de luz y buscar actividades en interiores para mantenerse activo y positivo.</p>
<h5 id="adaptacion-de-estilo-de-vida-y-costo-de-vida"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/ser-estudiante-de-doctorado-en-ciencias-de-la-computaci%C3%B3n-en-noruega/#adaptacion-de-estilo-de-vida-y-costo-de-vida">Adaptación de estilo de vida y costo de vida</a></h5>
<p>Además del clima, mudarse a Noruega implica adaptarse a un estilo de vida y costumbres diferentes. Los noruegos suelen valorar la privacidad y el espacio personal, y las interacciones sociales pueden sentirse más reservadas en comparación con otras culturas. El clima también influye en la vida social—las actividades al aire libre pueden ser limitadas en invierno, y la gente suele pasar más tiempo en interiores.</p>
<p>Adicionalmente, Noruega es conocida por su alto costo de vida. Gastos cotidianos como vivienda, alimentos, transporte y salir a comer pueden ser mucho más altos que en muchos otros países. Si bien el salario y los beneficios para estudiantes de doctorado ayudan a compensar estos costos, una buena planificación financiera es esencial, especialmente en los primeros meses mientras te adaptas.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/06/22/ser-estudiante-de-doctorado-en-ciencias-de-la-computaci%C3%B3n-en-noruega/#conclusion">Conclusión</a></h3>
<p>Antes que nada, si has llegado hasta aquí, ¡gracias por leer! :)</p>
<p>Un doctorado en Ciencias de la Computación en Noruega ofrece una combinación única de empleo profesional, sólidos beneficios sociales, seguridad financiera y un entorno académico de apoyo—todo en un país reconocido por su belleza natural y alta calidad de vida. Si te apasiona la investigación y estás listo para un viaje desafiante pero gratificante, Noruega es una excelente elección.</p>

<p>Hace unos meses, me encontraba en la activa búsqueda de programas de Doctorado para continuar mis estudios y no sabía por dónde empezar. A pesar de la abundancia de información en Internet, nunca logré encontrar un blog con tips especificos que se ajustaran a mi realidad. Por esto, he decidido compartir mi experiencia y compartir algunos consejos que me fueron útiles en la búsqueda de un programa de doctorado en el extranjero.</p>
<p>Antes de comenzar, quiero señalar algunos puntos importantes. En primer lugar, soy consciente de que mi experiencia no es universal; es posible que lo que me funcionó a mí no se aplique a todos. Además, hay muchas otras maneras de abordar esta búsqueda, más allá de las que compartiré aquí. En segundo lugar, debo aclarar que no soy doctor ni estudiante de doctorado. Es más, actualmente, trabajo en una startup de Inteligencia Artificial. Sin embargo, logré conseguir algunas entrevistas exitosas. En tercer lugar, mis consejos estarán principalmente orientados a la búsqueda de estudios de posgrado en Ciencias de la Computación e Inteligencia Artificial, dado que esta es mi área de formación. Aunque creo que estos consejos generales pueden ser de utilidad en otras áreas, los detalles más específicos se centrarán en las disciplinas de Ciencias de la Ingeniería.</p>
<h3 id="porque-seguir-estudios-de-doctorado"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/03/03/tips-para-buscar-phd-en-el-extranjero/#porque-seguir-estudios-de-doctorado">¿Porqué seguir estudios de Doctorado?</a></h3>
<p>Esta es una pregunta crucial que una persona debe ser capaz de responder al comenzar la búsqueda de estudios de postgrado, ya sea de maestría o doctorado. Esto se debe a que, aunque estudiar en otro país puede ser la mejor experiencia de tu vida, existen numerosos riesgos que deberás enfrentar. Entre ellos se incluyen dejar a tu familia y amigos, aprender nuevos idiomas (ya que el inglés podría servir para comunicarse en el ámbito universitario, pero no necesariamente en el día a día de una cultura diferente, donde las personas no tienen por qué saber hablar inglés para comunicarse con extranjeros). Otro punto a considerar es la situación financiera; seguir un programa de maestría o doctorado significa que posiblemente no podrás trabajar durante varios años. Y, aunque las becas proveen para vivir durante ese tiempo, es mucho menos dinero que el salario que podrías obtener en la industria. Por estas y otras razones, responder a esta pregunta es fundamental: ¿Por qué quieres estudiar una Maestría o un Doctorado? Sea cual sea tu motivación, debe ser firme, ya que, aunque podría ser la mejor aventura de tu vida, no quita que también podría ser una de las más difíciles. Si aún no sabes la respuesta a esta pregunta, dejo algunos enlaces que podrían ayudarte a encontrarla:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/4-compelling-reasons-why-pursuing-phd-worth-globalresearchnetwork/">4 Compelling Reasons Why Pursuing a PhD is Worth It</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/grad-school-advice/why-you-shouldnt-pursue-phd">Why You Shouldn’t Get a PhD</a></li>
</ul>
<p>De cualquier manera, no quiero desmotivar ni asustar a nadie. Si bien es cierto que pueden existir días difíciles durante tus estudios, lo importante es creer en uno mismo y nunca rendirse. La vida es corta y los sueños están para cumplirse. Así que, si estás pensando o dudando por las dificultades que podrían surgir, no te preocupes; si has llegado hasta aquí, ya sea para una maestría o un doctorado, puedes lograrlo.</p>
<h3 id="por-donde-empezar"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/03/03/tips-para-buscar-phd-en-el-extranjero/#por-donde-empezar">¿Por donde empezar?</a></h3>
<p>Creo que esta es la parte más importante de este blog. Por cierto, si han llegado hasta aquí, ¡muchas gracias por leer! 😊</p>
<p>Continuando, una pregunta importante es cómo empezar a buscar. ¿Es mejor comenzar por la universidad o el supervisor?, o quizás, ¿el lugar, por ejemplo, el país de destino? Pues la verdad, ninguna de estas opciones es el mejor punto de partida. Lo más recomendable es comenzar por la disciplina. Y cuando digo disciplina, no me refiero a algo general como investigar en IA, sino a los subcampos que puede englobar. Por ejemplo, en mi caso personal, inicialmente estaba muy interesado en investigar sobre Procesamiento de Lenguaje Natural (NLP) y Recuperación de Información (IR), ya que fue lo que investigué durante mi maestría y era lo que más conocía. Sin embargo, después de leer muchos artículos sobre el tema y hablar con más personas, decidí que me interesaba más investigar sobre Aprendizaje Reforzado (RL). Aunque es una línea diferente a lo que ya había hecho, creo que es fundamental ser exigente y honesto con lo que TÚ realmente quieres hacer, ya que pasarás al menos de 2 a 4 años investigando y trabajando en algo que podría definir tu futuro.</p>
<p>Luego de definir la disciplina que quieres aprender e investigar, el siguiente paso más importante es definir el tema o tópico; me refiero al potencial tema sobre el que trabajarás en tu tesis de maestría o doctorado. Alguien podría argumentar, ¿pero por qué sería necesario tener esto tan claro desde el principio? ¿No podría simplemente hablarlo con mi futuro supervisor? Eso es cierto. Sin embargo, cuanto más claras tengas estas dos cosas como futuro estudiante, mayor ventaja tendrás sobre el resto, ya que podrás focalizar tu búsqueda en supervisores que trabajen activamente en la disciplina y tópico que hayas escogido. Créeme, esto facilitará mucho la búsqueda por dos razones. Primero, podrás filtrar a los supervisores que trabajen en dichas áreas y tópicos, y segundo, mientras más claras tengas tus ideas, será más fácil conseguir una respuesta de ellos.</p>
<h3 id="como-empezar-a-buscar-y-financiamiento"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/03/03/tips-para-buscar-phd-en-el-extranjero/#como-empezar-a-buscar-y-financiamiento">¿Cómo empezar a buscar y financiamiento?</a></h3>
<p>Luego de haber decidido la disciplina y el tópico, surge la pregunta de cómo empezar a buscar un potencial supervisor en mis áreas de interés. En mi experiencia, identifiqué cuatro formas en las que pude, al menos, enviar mis antecedentes a varios potenciales supervisores:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buscar supervisores de paper interesantes que hayan leído.</li>
<li>Páginas de anuncios.</li>
<li>Proyectos de investigación en institutos y/o universidades.</li>
<li>Utilizando redes sociales.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="potenciales-supervisores-a-traves-de-articulos-interesantes"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/03/03/tips-para-buscar-phd-en-el-extranjero/#potenciales-supervisores-a-traves-de-articulos-interesantes">Potenciales supervisores a través de articulos interesantes.</a></h4>
<p>Quizás sea el más obvio de todos, pero buscar supervisores dispuestos a investigar en tus áreas de interés a través de artículos que ellos mismos hayan publicado es un gran punto de partida para iniciar una conversación con ellos. Para esto, hay muchas páginas desde donde comenzar a buscar, pero la más simple, en mi opinión, es <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> ya que allí pueden encontrar artículos interesantes a través de palabras claves, de la misma manera que utilizamos el buscador normal de Google. Por ejemplo, si desean investigar sobre Visión por Computadora como disciplina y análisis de imágenes usando Deep Learning como tópico, pueden utilizar las palabras clave "Computer Vision" y "Deep Learning". Luego, aparecerán una serie de artículos científicos que podrían ser de su interés, en los cuales identificar potenciales supervisores. Posteriormente, pueden buscar en Google el nombre del investigador o investigadora y encontrar mayor información sobre ellos y conocer más de su trabajo. Generalmente, los investigadores poseen páginas personales donde muestran su trabajo o perfiles en las universidades donde trabajan.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, un considerable obstáculo es que, aunque estos supervisores puedan estar dispuestos a trabajar en un proyecto de tesis, es posible que no dispongan de fuentes de financiamiento. Esto podría impedir que sean capaces de supervisar tu trabajo adecuadamente. No obstante, en el contexto de Chile, existe el programa de becas Chile, que ofrece la posibilidad de obtener financiamiento para estudios a través de una postulación rigurosa. Por lo tanto, es crucial mencionar este aspecto cuando contactes a un potencial supervisor.</p>
<h4 id="paginas-de-anuncios"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/03/03/tips-para-buscar-phd-en-el-extranjero/#paginas-de-anuncios">Páginas de anuncios</a></h4>
<p>A través de Internet, existen muchas páginas de anuncios donde los investigadores ofrecen proyectos de tesis (principalmente de doctorado) con una descripción detallada del laboratorio donde trabajan, el proyecto y las fuentes de financiamiento. Las que más recomiendo son:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="">https://www.findaphd.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="">https://academicpositions.es/jobs/position/phd</a></li>
<li><a href="">http://scholarshipdb.net/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Cada una de ellas cuenta con filtros principales que facilitan la búsqueda.</p>
<h4 id="proyectos-de-investigacion-en-institutos-yo-universidades"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/03/03/tips-para-buscar-phd-en-el-extranjero/#proyectos-de-investigacion-en-institutos-yo-universidades">Proyectos de investigación en institutos y/o universidades</a></h4>
<p>Muchas universidades e institutos disponen de varios proyectos de investigación liderados por alguno de sus académicos. Al igual que en el punto anterior, estos proyectos cuentan con una descripción detallada del laboratorio donde trabajan, el proyecto, si hay o no fuentes de financiamiento disponibles, y un contacto para responder dudas sobre el proyecto.</p>
<p>Sé que es más difícil acceder a este tipo de anuncios. Quizás, en este caso, aconsejaría empezar la búsqueda por la universidad de interés antes que por el tópico y disciplina. En este sentido, al identificar una potencial universidad, quizás de acuerdo a algún ranking, revisar si para su área de interés existen proyectos de investigación asociados.</p>
<p>Por ejemplo, la <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/">Universidad de Queensland</a>, en Brisbane, Australia, tiene una <a href="https://apply.uq.edu.au/">página de anuncios</a> de proyectos de investigación.</p>
<h4 id="utilizando-redes-sociales"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/03/03/tips-para-buscar-phd-en-el-extranjero/#utilizando-redes-sociales">Utilizando redes sociales</a></h4>
<p>Quizás suene extraño, pero muchos investigadores ofrecen sus proyectos de investigación a potenciales estudiantes a través de redes sociales como <a href="https://twitter.com/home">X</a> o <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/">LinkedIn</a>. Una forma de acceder a estas oportunidades es escribir "PhD Position in Reinforcement Learning" en los buscadores de estas redes (por eso fundamental haber elegido al menos la disciplina), ajustando el filtro a las últimas publicaciones. De esta manera, siempre encontraba varias posiciones que podrían ser de mi interés cada cierto tiempo. A veces, es posible que no encuentres nada interesante, por lo que es necesario repetir la búsqueda periódicamente.</p>
<h3 id="cierre"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/03/03/tips-para-buscar-phd-en-el-extranjero/#cierre">Cierre</a></h3>
<p>Finalmente, muchas gracias por leer! y espero, que estos consejos les sean de utilidad. También debo decir que buscar un programa de doctorado es una tarea difícil y frustrante que puede tomar meses quizás hasta años, pero como dije lo importante es no rendirse y creer en uno mismo, los sueños son para cumplirlos. Si les gustaría profundizar sobre el tema u otras dudas relacionadas, en la página de inicio se encuentran mis correos profesionales. De nuevo, gracias por leer y mucha suerte en la búsqueda! 😊😊😊</p>
